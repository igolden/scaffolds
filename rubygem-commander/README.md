My Gem Scaffold
===

Opinionated gem scaffold for rapid gemming.

### Why? 

Building a gem is (IMHO) the superior way to package scripting utilities for your day to day workflows. Packaging a gem (or any X module) makes sharing with coworkers, installing across computers, and using in distributed ENVs a breeze. So this repo is all about rapid gem development for myself.

### What does my scaffold *require*?

These are the things that are particularly important to *me*. When I start a gem I don't want to think about the things I know/want to already be decided.

*Note: a great way to start a gem without any understanding of a workflow is `bundle gem <dest>`, which is what this scaffold improves upon. It is only an **improvement** because I save **myself** time when developing, and anyone else who enjoys using the same tools as I do*.
